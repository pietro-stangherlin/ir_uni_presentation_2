# Information Retrieval University Project 2: Query Expansion

## Description
Make a "toy" collection, define some queries and relevance judgments.
Indicize the collection.
Run the queries, for each quey use the descriptors of the first ranked document to expand the query.
Evaluate the results.

## Considerations
### Assuming:
- binary relevance
- simple collection

### Evaluation measures
MAP
- before expansion 
- after expansion

### Difficulties
- building of the collection and queries: we can't get rid of our BIAS during building it
